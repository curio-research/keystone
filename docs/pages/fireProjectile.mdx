# Shots Fired

Now that we can move our player, let’s actually have some fun, shall we?

## Objective

1. Create projectiles that get updated in position over time
2. Prevent projectiles from going through obstacles/animals/players
3. Replace the animal/player with some resource/gold on death

The `FireProjectileSystem` is also a request-based system, but it is unique in that it queues a request to another system internally.

```go
type FireProjectileRequest struct {
	Direction helper.Direction `json:"direction"`
	PlayerId  int              `json:"playerId"`
}

var FireProjectileSystem = server.CreateSystemFromRequestHandler(func(ctx *server.TransactionCtx[FireProjectileRequest]) {
	req := ctx.Req.Data
	w := ctx.W

	direction := req.Direction
	initialPosition, found := locationOfPlayer(w, req.PlayerId)
	if !found {
		return
	}

	projectileID := data.Projectile.Add(w, data.ProjectileSchema{ // Explanation 1
		Position: initialPosition,
	})

	tickNumber := ctx.GameCtx.GameTick.TickNumber + constants.BulletSpeed

	server.QueueTxFromInternal[UpdateProjectileRequest](w, tickNumber, server.NewKeystoneTx(UpdateProjectileRequest{ // Explanation 2
		Direction:    direction,
		ProjectileID: projectileID,
		PlayerID:     req.PlayerId,
	}, nil), "")
}, VerifyWalletAndIdentity[FireProjectileRequest]())

func locationOfPlayer(w state.IWorld, playerId int) (state.Pos, bool) {
	playerEntity := data.Player.Filter(w, data.PlayerSchema{PlayerId: playerId}, []string{"PlayerId"})
	if len(playerEntity) == 0 {
		return state.Pos{}, false
	}

	player := data.Player.Get(w, playerEntity[0])
	return player.Position, true
}
```

```go
type UpdateProjectileRequest struct {
	Direction    helper.Direction
	ProjectileID int
	PlayerID     int
}

var UpdateProjectileSystem = server.CreateSystemFromRequestHandler(func(ctx *server.TransactionCtx[UpdateProjectileRequest]) {
	w := ctx.W
	req := ctx.Req.Data

	// get projectile's position
	projectile := data.Projectile.Get(w, req.ProjectileID)

	nextPosition := helper.TargetTile(projectile.Position, req.Direction)

	// check collisions
	collision := updateWorldForCollision(w, nextPosition)
	if collision {
		// if collided, remove the projectile
		data.Projectile.RemoveEntity(w, req.ProjectileID)

	} else {
		// update the position of the projectile
		projectile.Position = nextPosition
		data.Projectile.Set(w, req.ProjectileID, projectile)

		// queue the next projectile update
		tickNumber := ctx.GameCtx.GameTick.TickNumber + constants.BulletSpeed

		server.QueueTxFromInternal[UpdateProjectileRequest](w, tickNumber, server.NewKeystoneTx(UpdateProjectileRequest{
			Direction:    req.Direction,
			ProjectileID: req.ProjectileID,
			PlayerID:     req.PlayerID,
		}, nil), "")
	}

})
```

## Explanation

1. We get the position of the player and add a projectile in that location. We start the projectile from the position of a player since we can be sure that the projectile will be fine to start there.
2. We queue a job to the `UpdateProjectileSystem` in `constants.BulletSpeed` more ticks.
 1. In the `UpdateProjectileSystem`, we check for collisions using `Filter` and update the position of the projectile one more step in its intended direction if possible.
 2. On collision, we apply the effects of the collision to the map, including the dropping of resources, or just the removal of the projectile entity.

It is usually best for design in general to have one system be responsible for one thing, whether that’s creating the projectile or updating its location. Although it is a bit weird to start a projectile in the same position as the player, it is a tradeoff we were willing to make.

**Note:** Be careful about queuing jobs for the future, because if the system doesn't tick on the exact tick you scheduled it on, then you are going to miss the update.

When you are doing something like this:

```go
tickNumberToScheduleJobFor := ctx.GameCtx.GameTick.TickNumber + [TickIncrement]
```

Two tips (`TickInterval` refers to the system you are queuing a job to) :

1. Make sure that your `TickIncrement` is a multiple of the `TickInterval` / `TickRate`
2. Make sure that the `TickInterval` % `TickRate` is 0. We round down if the expected tick is a decimal, and it’s nice to avoid changing intervals when scheduling jobs.
