# Player Movement

Now that we’ve seen how the player is created, the next thing you might want to know is how this player moves and fights. After all, what good is creating a player if you can’t fight the enemies?

Let’s start with movement!

## Objectives

1. Pass in a simple request into the backend (read: minimize request data) to move the player
2. Create a system that verifies the position against constraints and updates the player’s position

The movement system, like the `CreatePlayerSystem` is triggered when a request is made to the system.

```go
type MovePlayerRequest struct {
	Direction helper.Direction `json:"direction"`
	PlayerId  int              `json:"playerId"`
}

var MovePlayerSystem = server.CreateSystemFromRequestHandler(func(ctx *server.TransactionCtx[MovePlayerRequest]) {
	w := ctx.W
	req := ctx.Req.Data

	playerRes := data.Player.Filter(w,
		data.PlayerSchema{
			PlayerId: req.PlayerId,
		}, []string{"PlayerId"}) // Explanation 1
	if len(playerRes) == 0 {
		ctx.EmitError("you have not created a player yet", []int{req.PlayerId})
		return
	}

	player := data.Player.Get(w, playerRes[0])
	targetPos := helper.TargetTile(player.Position, req.Direction)
	validTileToMove := helper.ValidateTileToMoveTo(w, targetPos) // Explanation 2

	if validTileToMove {
		player.Position = targetPos

		// add any resources the player gained at the position
		resource, found := resourceAtPosition(w, targetPos) // Explanation 3
		if found {
			data.Resource.RemoveEntity(w, resource.Id)
			player.Resources += resource.Amount
		}

		data.Player.Set(w, player.Id, player)
	}
}, VerifyWalletAndIdentity[MovePlayerRequest]())

func resourceAtPosition(w state.IWorld, position state.Pos) (data.ResourceSchema, bool) {
	resource := data.Resource.Filter(w, data.ResourceSchema{
		Position: position,
	}, []string{"Position"})

	if len(resource) == 0 {
		return data.ResourceSchema{}, false
	}
	return data.Resource.Get(w, resource[0]), true
}
```

We are able to simplify the request by only asking for the `PlayerId`, because we can easily get the `Position` and related information like `Resources` once we find the `PlayerSchema`.

```go
type MovePlayerRequest struct {
	Direction helper.Direction `json:"direction"`
	PlayerId  int              `json:"playerId"`
}
```

Just like we did in the  `CreatePlayerSystem` , we `Filter` for players with the playerID, but this time to check whether the player the user is referring to exists.

```go
playerRes := data.Player.Filter(w,
		data.PlayerSchema{
			PlayerId: req.PlayerId,
		}, []string{"PlayerId"}) // Explanation 1
	if len(playerRes) == 0 {
		ctx.EmitError("you have not created a player yet", []int{req.PlayerId})
		return
	}
```

`ValidateTileToMoveTo` confirms across different schemas (using, surprise, `Filter` !) that an object doesn’t exist at the position we are seeking to go to.

```go
func ValidateTileToMoveTo(w state.IWorld, pos state.Pos) bool {
	if !WithinBoardBoundary(pos) {
		return false
	}

	if players := data.Player.Filter(w, data.PlayerSchema{ // no players
		Position: pos,
	}, []string{"Position"}); len(players) != 0 {
		return false
	}

	if animals := data.Animal.Filter(w, data.AnimalSchema{ // no animals
		Position: pos,
	}, []string{"Position"}); len(animals) != 0 {
		return false
	}

	return !IsObstacleTile(w, pos) // no obstacles
}
```

We pick up resources by:

1. Adding the resource count to the game world and
2. Deleting the resource object from the game world after we pick it up
 1. Deleting an object is done through the `RemoveEntity` function of the TableAccessor, which means you need to store the entity/find the entity through a `Filter` beforehand

```go
resource, found := resourceAtPosition(w, targetPos) // Explanation 3
		if found {
			data.Resource.RemoveEntity(w, resource.Id)
			player.Resources += resource.Amount
		}
```

Two important parameters to consider when adding a system to the game are:

1. **Game Tick rate**: ***************************************************How many milliseconds should pass between each tick***************************************************, set in the `TickRate`. This will be the limit to how fast tick events can be processed. We decided to have a `TickRate` of `20` milliseconds.
2. ********************************************System Tick Interval:******************************************** *************************************************How many milliseconds should pass between each time we process jobs for the system*************************************************, set in the `TickInterval` of the `TickSystem` . Be careful about queuing jobs for the future, because if the system doesn’t tick on the exact tick you scheduled it on, then you are going to miss the update. As a good practice, make sure that the `TickRate` is a number that is easy to always be a multiple of, like `100` as we did in our game.

We decided for simplicity that most systems should have a `TickInterval` matching the `TickRate`.
