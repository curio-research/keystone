# Initializing the Engine/World

```go
func main() {
	// Initialize new game engine
	ctx := startKeystone.NewGameEngine()

	ctx.SetTickRate(constants.TickRate)

	// Add systems
	startup.AddSystems(ctx)

	// Setup HTTP routes
	startup.SetupRoutes(ctx)

	// Register tables schemas to world
	ctx.AddTables(data.SchemaMapping)

	// Provision local SQLite
	gormDB, err := gorm.Open(sqlite.Open("local.db"))
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to connect database: " + err.Error())
	}

	SQLiteSaveStateHandler, SQLiteSaveTxHandler, err := gamedb.SQLHandlersFromDialector(gormDB.Dialector, ctx.GameId, data.SchemaMapping)
	if err != nil {
		panic("failed to create sqlite save handlers: " + err.Error())
	}

	startKeystone.RegisterRewindEndpoint(ctx)

	ctx.SetSaveStateHandler(SQLiteSaveStateHandler, 0)
	ctx.SetSaveTxHandler(SQLiteSaveTxHandler, 0)

	ctx.SetSaveState(false)
	ctx.SetSaveTx(false)

	// Initialize game map
	startup.InitWorld(ctx)

	// Start game server!
	ctx.Start()
}
```

So many things to set! Letâ€™s go through what is required and what is optional:

## Required

1. `SetupRoutes` - This sets routes to the `GinHttpEngine`, which is the `gin` Router through which HTTP requests are handled. You can replace the logic inside the `SetupRoutes` function to handle requests and queue them into your systems.

Just make sure that your route for taking in requests to your systems follows this format:

```go
ctx.GinHttpEngine.POST("/endpoint", func(ginCtx *gin.Context) {
		pushUpdateToQueue[RequestType](ginCtx, ctx)
})
```

1. `AddSystems` - As we are going to discuss in the upcoming sections, a system is the workhorse of the engine, so we need to remember to add some if we want to actually do something in our game!

    After you create a system, you can add it in `AddSystems` using the format:

    ```go
    ctx.AddSystem(constants.TickRate, systems.System) // (ms between system call rate, system)
    ```


 3. `AddTables` - For all the data we need to store inside the game, we have to create a table for each type of data in the initialization of the game. You will see that the function actually takes in a `map[interface{}]*state.TableBaseAccessor[any]` instead of just a `[]interface{}`.

We went over the benefit of having global `TableAccessor`s in a previous section to more easily access data. Another benefit is that they implement `ITable` so they can be used to add tables to the world. That is the reason why `AddTables` takes in a type of `map[interface{}]*state.TableBaseAccessor[any]` .

```go
// schemas.go
var (
	Game            = state.NewTableAccessor[GameSchema]()
	LocalRandomSeed = state.NewTableAccessor[LocalRandSeedSchema]()
	...
)

var SchemaMapping = map[interface{}]*state.TableBaseAccessor[any]{
	&GameSchema{}:          (*state.TableBaseAccessor[any])(Game),
	&LocalRandSeedSchema{}: (*state.TableBaseAccessor[any])(LocalRandomSeed),
	...
}
```

Note: Your requests should not be added as a schema here! These are only for structures storing game data, to be used in systems processing a request.

## Optional

1. `SetTickRate` - sets the time interval between ticks (default `100ms`).
2. `SetStreamRate` - sets the time interval between batch pushing updates to WS (default `100ms`)
3. `startKeystone.RegisterRewindEndpoint` - supports rewinding your game
4. `SetSaveState` - allows pushing updates to the handler specified by `SetSaveStateHandler`
5.  `SetSaveTx` - allows pushing updates to the handler specified by `SetSaveTxHandler`
6. Pre-initialize your world - you can add tiles/players or things that should exist on the map before the game starts
    1. Note: these will not show up in the updates from `/subscribeTableUpdates`; you will need to get these in your client by using the `/getState` endpoint.


After you have done all of these, you can use `ctx.Start` to start iterating through systems and working the magic of `Keystone`!
