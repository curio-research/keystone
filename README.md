Keystone is a rollup framework in development that powers high performance onchain games, allowing developers to build the types of real-time games like Age of Empires, while combining EVM smart contracts for its composability.

In this release, we're showcasing the on-going entity-component-system based engine that will power the bulk of the game logic in keystone sequencers. The client is built in Unity.

Some features we're excited to bring alive:

- EVM execution: keystone will interoperate between its ecs engine and evm through precompiles
- Visual ECS editors
- Advanced event based service between client (eg. Unity) and the rollup state
- Smart contracts that will secure the Keystone architecture
